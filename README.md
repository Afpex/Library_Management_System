Library Management System ðŸ“š

Overview

This project is a simple Library Management System implemented in C. It incorporates various fundamental concepts such as structures, dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, and a command-line interface for user interaction. This project is ideal for sharpening software engineering skills and understanding the basics of C programming.

Features
Book and User Management: Add, remove, and list books and users.
Persistent Storage: Save and load library data using file I/O.
Dynamic Memory Management: Efficiently manage collections of books and users.
Command-Line Interface: Interact with the system using a simple CLI.
Modular Codebase: Well-structured code with proper use of header files and multiple source files.
Basic Error Handling: Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
